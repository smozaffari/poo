\chapter{Conclusion}

As we look past the "low hanging fruit" of GWAS, we turn to other biological mechanisms where genetics can influence our traits, including studies or rare variation\cite{Igartua:2017ir}, gene by environment interactions, and parent of origin effects among others. The Hutterites that the Ober Lab studies are an ideal population to look for parent of origin effects on quantitative disease related traits and gene expression\cite{Weiss:2005cq,Abney2001,Ober:2001dy}. With RNA-seq and novel methods for imputing and phasing data at a population scale\citep{Livne2015}, we are able to start getting at these questions.
