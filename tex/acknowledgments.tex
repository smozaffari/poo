\acknowledgments

I am truly grateful for the mentorship I received from my advisor, Carole Ober. I am very thankful for her support and guidance throughout the four years I have spent in her lab. 

I would also like to thank Dan Nicolae who constantly encouraged me to meet with him and helped me with statistical problems I never expected to encounter.

My committee has played an important role in my progress, and I am thankful for their advice and support. Yoav Gilad has always provided me with critical support that I have been greatly appreciative of.
