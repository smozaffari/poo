My decision to pursue Genetics in college came about after my program advisor, Sarah Dempsey, rightly so, refused to let me take both genetics and cell biology lab courses in the same semester. After crying in her office, I was forced to make a decision and chose the one I enjoyed learning about more and told myself I'd worry about the pre-optometry requirements later. It was through these genetics courses that I fell in love with the field and met Daniel Rokhsar. Dan took a chance on me and let me work in his lab for a senior honors thesis during my last year at UC Berkeley. He has since encouraged me and been a supporter of me and my science. Many thanks to Eric Edsinger and Jess Lyons for teaching me how to science, and Adam Session, Therese Mitros, Simon Prochnik, and Jessen Bredeson for teaching me how to code and work with genomic data. Special thanks to my undergraduate friends in the lab who are now pursuing their own graduate degrees: Cindy Ha and Konnor La. 

With only one year of science research under my belt, I was admitted into one graduate university - University of Chicago. Thank you to the GGSB faculty who fought for me to come here. I've had the great opportunity to work with some strong amazing women in science, Nancy Cox, Elizabeth McNally, and Hae Kyung Im, among many others, who have helped me along my graduate career from the beginning, from writing me strong letters of recommendation, supporting conference attendance, enrolling me in R Master classes with Hadley Wickham, and convincing me to become active in the science community on Twitter - all of which have contributed to make me the scientist I am today.

It should be acknowledged that none of this happened without any struggles. It's hard to forget the teaching assistant during my first year of graduate school, who instead of helping me, told me I didn't know anything and said the faculty questioned my presence in graduate school; the faculty who ultimately left UChicago but wouldn't admit their possible move as I was making my decision which lab to join; or the peers who forget that there are capable female computational biologists working right next to them and we can all learn from each other.

I would not have made it through graduate school without the support of my friends and colleagues. Katie Igartua and Michelle Stein, thanks for welcoming me to the lab, teaching me a lot of what I know today and leaving the bar quite high. Thanks to my cohort of Molecular Bioscience students who have gone through the same things with me since Day 1- especially Ana Beringer, Lindsey Mao, Erin Boyle Anderson, Chris Katanski, Phil McGilvray, Chris Craddock, and Beth Pollard. Thanks to my many friends from Biomedical Sciences 

I would like to thank the opportunities and outside activities that have helped keep me sane and motivated. Thanks to my fellow volunteers at the Museum of Science and Industry and Matt, Rene and Rudy for giving me the opportunity to teach adults and children about DNA for the past three years. Thanks to the Hyde Park Art Center and their great group of students and teachers in the screen printing classes. 

Thanks to my Aunt Peymaneh and Uncle Mahmood for sending me letters full of love, Halloween packages full of my favorite candy, and a whole slough of Christmas gifts for when I wasn't home to celebrate. Thanks to my grandma for always asking to FaceTime with me - but only for a short time to let me get back to work- and for sending me too many raw pistachios, pomegranates from her backyard, and homemade Persian sweets I miss during Persian New Year every year for the past five years. None of this would have been possible without the support of my parents, who didn't question my decision to move halfway across the country for the past five years but continued to visit (albeit only in the summer) and tell me how proud they are of me. Thanks for pushing me as hard as you did and taking care of me all of these years.
