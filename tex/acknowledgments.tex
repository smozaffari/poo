\acknowledgments

I am truly grateful for the mentorship I received from my advisor, Carole Ober. I am very thankful for her support and guidance throughout the four years I have spent in her lab. 

I would also like to thank Dan Nicolae who constantly encouraged me to meet with him and helped me with statistical problems I never expected to encounter. 

My committee has played an important role in making me the scientist I am, and I am thankful for their advice and help. Yoav Gilad has always been critical, yet supportive; Vincent Lynch always has his door open for my questions; John Novembre put us in touch with Sardinia collaborators to replicate findings from our studies.
